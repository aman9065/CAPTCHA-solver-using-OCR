# CAPTCHA Solver using OCR 🔐🧠

This is a Flask-based web application that reads and solves CAPTCHA images using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).  
It uses `pytesseract`, OpenCV, and image processing techniques to accurately extract and verify text from CAPTCHAs.  
It also includes login/signup functionality with password hashing and MySQL database.

## 📊 Reading Accuracy Analysis

Noise levels were increased from 10% to 90%, and OCR accuracy was tracked. Below is a summary:

| Noise Level | Accuracy         |
|-------------|------------------|
| 10%         | ~90%             |
| 25% + color | ~75-80%          |
| 50% + color | ~60-65%          |
| 75%         | ~45%             |
| 90%         | Failed (1–2 chars unreadable) |
